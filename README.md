# Facial_recognition-using-mobilenet

### This is a project to recognize my face. 
#### A pre-trained CNN model (Mobilenet was used in the detection of my face)
#### The model was trained with data of my face that I captured from my webcam

## This repository has the following files:
### face_detector_CNN: this ipynb file contains the source code to build and train up your model
### chukspred.py : this python file activates the model, it uses the webcam to detect in real-time the face
### webcam_image-capture.py: The model can be trained using data of your face. Using the "webcam_image-capture.py", you can activate your webcam to capture pictures of your face.
